## Document Inventory

### Loaded Documents
*   **PRD**: `docs/prd.md` (Core functional/non-functional requirements)
*   **Architecture**: `docs/architecture.md` (System design, patterns, stack)
*   **Epics**: `docs/epics.md` (Decomposition of requirements into implementation tasks)
*   **UX Design**: Not Found (Expected for a CLI tool - User Experience covered in PRD/Architecture CLI specs)
*   **Tech Spec**: Not applicable (BMad Method track uses Architecture)
*   **Brownfield**: Not applicable (Greenfield project)

### Inventory Assessment
All critical documents for the BMad Method (Greenfield) track are present. The absence of a dedicated `UX Design.md` is acceptable as the UI interaction (CLI) is defined within the Architecture document.

Proceeding to Deep Analysis.
